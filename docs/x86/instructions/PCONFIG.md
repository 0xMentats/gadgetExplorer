### Description
PCONFIG allows software to configure certain platform features. PCONFIG supports multiple leaf functions, with a
leaf function identified by the value in EAX. The registers RBX, RCX, and RDX have leaf-specific purposes.

Each PCONFIG leaf function applies to a specific hardware block called a PCONFIG target, and each PCONFIG target
is associated with a numerical identifier. The identifiers of the PCONFIG targets supported by the CPU (which imply
the supported leaf functions) are enumerated in the sub-leaves of the PCONFIG-information leaf of CPUID (EAX =
1BH). An attempt to execute an undefined leaf function results in a general-protection exception (\#GP).

Addresses and operands are 32 bits outside 64-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA = 0 || CS.L = 0) and are 64 bits in 64-bit
 mode (IA32_EFER.LMA = 1 && CS.L = 1). The value of CS.D has no effect on address calculation.

Table 2-2 shows the leaf encodings for PCONFIG.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RESERVED</td>
		<td>00000001H - FFFFFFFFH</td>
		<td>Reserved for future use (#GP(0) if used).</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM leaf of PCONFIG pertains to the MKTME target, which has target identifier 1. It is used
by software to manage the key associated with a KeyID. The leaf function is invoked by setting the leaf value of 0
in EAX and the address of MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM_STRUCT in RBX. Successful execution of the leaf clears RAX (set
to zero) and ZF, CF, PF, AF, OF, and SF are cleared. In case of failure, the failure reason is indicated in RAX with ZF
set to 1 and CF, PF, AF, OF, and SF are cleared. The MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM leaf uses the
MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM_STRUCT in memory shown in Table 2-3.

A description of each of the fields in MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM_STRUCT is provided below:

 *  KEYID: Key Identifier being programmed to the MKTME engine.

 *  KEYID_CTRL: The KEYID_CTRL field carries two sub-fields used by software to control the behavior of a

KeyID: Command and KeyID encryption algorithm.

The command used controls the encryption mode for a KeyID. Table 2-4 provides a summary of the
commands supported.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Command</b></td>
		<td><b>Encoding</b></td>
		<td><b>Description</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KEYID_SET_KEY_DIRECT</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>Software uses this mode to directly program a key for use with KeyID.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KEYID_SET_KEY_RANDOM</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>CPU generates and assigns an ephemeral key for use with a KeyID. Each time the instruction is executed, the CPU generates a new key using a hardware random number generator and the keys are discarded on reset.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KEYID_CLEAR_KEY</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>Clear the (software programmed) key associated with the KeyID. On execution of this command, the KeyID gets TME behavior (encrypt with platform TME key).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KEYID_NO_ENCRYPT</td>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>Do not encrypt memory when this KeyID is in use.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

The encryption algorithm field (ENC_ALG) allows software to select one of the activated encryption algorithms
for the KeyID. The BIOS can activate a set of algorithms to allow for use when programming keys using the
IA32_TME_ACTIVATE MSR (does not apply to KeyID 0 which uses TME policy). The ISA checks to ensure that
the algorithm selected by software is one of the algorithms that has been activated by the BIOS.

 *  KEY_FIELD_1: This field carries the software supplied data key to be used for the KeyID if the direct key

programming option is used (KEYID_SET_KEY_DIRECT). When the random key programming option is used
(KEYID_SET_KEY_RANDOM), this field carries the software supplied entropy to be mixed in the CPU generated
random data key. It is software's responsibility to ensure that the key supplied for the direct programming
option or the entropy supplied for the random programming option does not result in weak keys. There are no
explicit checks in the instruction to detect or prevent weak keys. When AES XTS-128 is used, the upper 48B are
treated as reserved and must be zeroed out by software before executing the instruction.

 *  KEY_FIELD_2: This field carries the software supplied tweak key to be used for the KeyID if the direct key

programming option is used (KEYID_SET_KEY_DIRECT). When the random key programming option is used
(KEYID_SET_KEY_RANDOM), this field carries the software supplied entropy to be mixed in the CPU generated
random tweak key. It is software's responsibility to ensure that the key supplied for the direct programming
option or the entropy supplied for the random programming option does not result in weak keys. There are no
explicit checks in the instruction to detect or prevent weak keys. When AES XTS-128 is used, the upper 48B are
treated as reserved and must be zeroed out by software before executing the instruction.

All KeyIDs use the TME key on MKTME activation. Software can at any point decide to change the key for a
KeyID using the PCONFIG instruction. Change of keys for a KeyID does NOT change the state of the TLB
caches or memory pipeline. It is software's responsibility to take appropriate actions to ensure correct
behavior.
Table 2-5 shows the return values associated with the MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM leaf of PCONFIG. On
instruction execution, RAX is populated with the return value.

PCONFIG Virtualization
Software in VMX root mode can control the execution of PCONFIG in VMX non-root mode using the following execu-
tion controls introduced for PCONFIG:

 * PCONFIG_ENABLE: This control is a single bit control and enables the PCONFIG instruction in VMX non-root
mode. If 0, the execution of PCONFIG in VMX non-root mode causes \#UD. Otherwise, execution of PCONFIG
works according to PCONFIG_EXITING.

 * PCONFIG_EXITING: This is a 64b control and allows VMX root mode to cause a VM-exit for various leaf
functions of PCONFIG. This control does not have any effect if the PCONFIG_ENABLE control is clear.

PCONFIG Concurrency
In a scenario, where the MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM leaf of PCONFIG is executed concurrently on multiple logical
processors, only one logical processor will succeed in updating the key table. PCONFIG execution will return with an
error code (DEVICE_BUSY) on other logical processors and software must retry. In cases where the instruction
execution fails with a DEVICE_BUSY error code, the key table is not updated, thereby ensuring that either the key
table is updated in its entirety with the information for a KeyID, or it is not updated at all. In order to accomplish
this, the MKTME_KEY_PROGRAM leaf of PCONFIG maintains a writer lock for updating the key table. This lock is
referred to as the Key table lock and denoted in the instruction flows as KEY_TABLE_LOCK. The lock can either be
unlocked, when no logical processor is holding the lock (also the initial state of the lock) or be in an exclusive state
where a logical processor is trying to update the key table. There can be only one logical processor holding the lock
in exclusive state. The lock, being exclusive, can only be acquired when the lock is in unlocked state.

PCONFIG uses the following syntax to acquire KEY_TABLE_LOCK in exclusive mode and release the lock:

 *  KEY_TABLE_LOCK.ACQUIRE(WRITE)

 *  KEY_TABLE_LOCK.RELEASE()
