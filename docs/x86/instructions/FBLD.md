### Description
Converts the BCD source operand into double extended-precision floating-point format and pushes the value onto
the FPU stack. The source operand is loaded without rounding errors. The sign of the source operand is preserved,
including that of −0.

The packed BCD digits are assumed to be in the range 0 through 9; the instruction does not check for invalid digits
(AH through FH). Attempting to load an invalid encoding produces an undefined result.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

### Operation

```java
TOP ← TOP − 1;
ST(0) ← ConvertToDoubleExtendedPrecisionFP(SRC); 
```
### FPU Flags Affected

C1
Set to 1 if stack overflow occurred; otherwise, set to 0.
C0, C2, C3
Undefined.

### Floating-Point Exceptions

<p>#IS
Stack overflow occurred.

### Protected Mode Exceptions

<p>#GP(0)
If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment selector.
<p>#SS(0)
If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
<p>#NM
CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
<p>#PF(fault-code)
If a page fault occurs.
<p>#AC(0)
If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the
current privilege level is 3.
<p>#UD
If the LOCK prefix is used.

### Real-Address Mode Exceptions

<p>#GP
If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
<p>#SS
If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
<p>#NM
CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
<p>#UD
If the LOCK prefix is used.

### Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions

<p>#GP(0)
If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
<p>#SS(0)
If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS segment limit.
<p>#NM
CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
<p>#PF(fault-code)
If a page fault occurs.
<p>#AC(0)
If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made.
<p>#UD
If the LOCK prefix is used.

### Compatibility Mode Exceptions
Same exceptions as in protected mode.

### 64-Bit Mode Exceptions

<p>#SS(0)
If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-canonical form.
<p>#GP(0)
If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
<p>#NM
CR0.EM[bit 2] or CR0.TS[bit 3] = 1.
<p>#MF
If there is a pending x87 FPU exception.
<p>#PF(fault-code)
If a page fault occurs.
<p>#AC(0)
If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the
current privilege level is 3.
<p>#UD
If the LOCK prefix is used.
